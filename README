pIqaD nap  
===================

What is it?
-----------

pIqaD nap is a typeface for the Klingon pIqaD script, with a simplified design.
You can think of it as a "sans-serif" interpretation of the pIqaD forms. It was
designed with the intention of simplifying the glyph forms while keeping them
recognizable to experienced pIqaD readers. pIqaD nap uses the encoding for
Klingon pIqaD registered in the ConScript Unicode Registry within the Private
Use Area of the Basic Multilingual Plane from code points U+F8D0 to U+F8FF.

What can I do with it?
----------------------

Just about anything you want, under the terms of the SIL Open Font License.
See the COPYING file for further details. Installing the font on your computer
will allow you to view documents and messages written in pIqaD if you do not
already have a pIqaD font installed, and will expand your available typefaces
if you already have one or more pIqaD fonts. With the addition of a pIqaD input
method, you can also compose documents and messages in pIqaD.
