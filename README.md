DanIlmoH's pIqaD fonts
======================

What's this?
------------

DanIlmoH's pIqaD fonts is a collection of Klingon pIqaD fonts (which currently
consists of a single font), using the encoding for Klingon pIqaD registered in
the ConScript Unicode Registry within the Private Use Area of the Unicode Basic
Multilingual Plane from code points U+F8D0 to U+F8FF.

These fonts and their revision history are available on my (Daniel Dadap's)
GitHub page at:

https://github.com/dadap/pIqaD-fonts/

I am not an experienced fontographer, so I will likely revise the fonts from
time to time to correct mistakes. When this happens for an already released
font, I will increment that font's version number with a semantic versioning
scheme, with the major number representing changes to the font's metrics, the
minor number representing all other changes to the font that do not affect its
metrics, and the patch number representing documentation or packaging changes
that do not affect the font.

### pIqaD qolqoS  

pIqaD qolqoS is a typeface of the Klingon pIqaD script with a simplified design.
You can think of it as a "sans-serif" interpretation of the pIqaD forms. It was
designed with the intention of simplifying the glyph forms while keeping them
recognizable to experienced pIqaD readers.

What can I do with these fonts?
-------------------------------

Just about anything you want, under the terms of the SIL Open Font License.
See the LICENSE file for further details. Installing the fonts on your computer
will allow you to view documents and messages written in pIqaD if you do not
already have a pIqaD font installed, and will expand your available typefaces
if you already have one or more pIqaD fonts. With the addition of a pIqaD input
method, you can also compose documents and messages in pIqaD.

### Acknowledgements specific to pIqaD qolqoS

The glyph of the Klingon Empire logo (listed in the ConScript Unicode Registry
as "KLINGON MUMMIFICATION GLYPH") at code point U+F8FF was copied from the
"pIqaD" font by qurgh, which was downloaded from:
